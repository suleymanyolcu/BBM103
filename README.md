# Programming Laboratory Assignments

## Overview

This repository contains the assignments and related materials for the programming laboratory conducted during [BBM103/Fall 2022-2023]. The assignments cover various topics and concepts, including 2D Lists, File IO operations, functions, probability, file operations, lists, functions, dictionaries, multi-dimensional lists, game design, exception handling, machine learning, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, classification, and data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.


## Doctor's Aid
This assignment focuses on a probability-based decision system called Doctor’s Aid for clinicians.
including 2D Lists, File IO operations, functions, and probability.

## Football Ticket System
This assignment focuses on a console-based basic Football ticketing system
including file operations, lists, functions, and dictionaries. 

## Battle of Ships
This assignment is Battleship (also known as Battleships or Sea Battle) is a strategy-type guessing game for
two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player’s fleet of
warships is marked. The Battle of Ships assignment focuses on multi-dimensional lists, game design, exception handling, and functions.

## Personality Classification
This assignment  focuses on K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to classify different personality types (16 personalities) of people.
This assignment involves machine learning, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, classification, and data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
